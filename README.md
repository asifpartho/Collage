# Requirements

macOS 10.10 or later

# How to use

Click with right mouse button inside any frame to see pop-up menu that allows you to split current frame or to upload new picture.
All you need to change size and proportions of the frames is just a move of a mouse â€” drag frame border with left mouse button. You can also change application window size for that purpose.
